Create ECUC configuration in JSON format for a given path and names mapping.
1. Path is a '/' separated string representing ECUC hierarchy.
It should be taken from get_precise_definition_path_using_rapidfuzz.
It should contain parts that are taken from get_definition or known ECUC parts.
2. Names is a dictionary mapping ECUC parts to desired names.
The tool generates nested JSON structure representing the ECUC configuration.

Example:
-------
Prompt: Create ComIPdu with the name ESP_19.
Given path: "/com/comconfig/comipdu"
And names: {"comipdu": "ESP_19"}
