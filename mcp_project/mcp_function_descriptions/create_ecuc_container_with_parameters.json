    "description": "Create an ECUC container JSON for a given definition `path` and `names` mapping, and parameters as optional.\nInput parameter name provided by user might be incorrect and deviate from its actual name defined in the ParamDef. Make sure MCP tools like `get_definition_file_from_keyword` and `get_precise_definition_path_using_rapidfuzz` are used to get the correct tag name before proceeding with the next steps.\nCaller MUST perform two MCP calls in this order:\n1) `get_available_containers(path)` — discover existing container instances for each element in the `path` and obtain the available shortNames.\n2) `create_ecuc_container_with_parameters(path, names, parameters)` — create the requested container.\nBehavior expectations:\n- The caller is responsible for filling any missing parent names using the results of `get_available_containers(path)` before calling this tool.\n- Keys in `names` are matched case-insensitively; provided values are used verbatim as the new shortName for the target element.\n- If the caller does not resolve parent names prior to calling this tool, the create operation may fail or produce unintended results.\n- To implement an alternate resolution policy, call `get_available_containers` yourself and compute the desired parent names prior to calling this tool."
