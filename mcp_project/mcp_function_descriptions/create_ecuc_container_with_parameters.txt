Create an ECUC container JSON for a given definition `path` and `names` mapping, and parameters as optional.

Input parameter name provided by user might be incorrect
and deviate from its actual name defined in the ParamDef.
Make sure MCP tools like `get_definition_file_from_keyword`
and `get_precise_definition_path_using_rapidfuzz` are used
to get the correct tag name before proceeding with the next steps.

After which, Caller MUST perform two MCP calls in this order:
1) `get_available_containers(path)` — discover existing container instances
        for each element in the `path` and obtain the available shortNames.
2) `create_ecuc_container_with_parameters(path, names, parameters)` — create the requested container.

Behavior expectations:
- The caller is responsible for filling any missing parent names using
    the results of `get_available_containers(path)` before calling this tool.
- Keys in `names` are matched case-insensitively; provided values are
    used verbatim as the new shortName for the target element.
- If the caller does not resolve parent names prior to calling this tool,
    the create operation may fail or produce unintended results.
- To implement an alternate resolution policy, call `get_available_containers`
    yourself and compute the desired parent names prior to calling this tool.
